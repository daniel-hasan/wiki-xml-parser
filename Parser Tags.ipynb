The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonize Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture which included churches, civic architecture including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside. During 19th century Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture. In the 1950s the [[modernist architecture]] was introduced when [[Brasilia]] was built as new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior.

      "Two interpretations are given for the origin of the name Minas Gerais.<ref>[http://portal.matiascardoso.mg.gov.br:8080/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1016.6 João Batista de Almeida Costa. Os Berços de Minas Gerais] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706155757/http://portal.matiascardoso.mg.gov.br:8080/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1016.6 |date=2011-07-06 }}</ref> It comes from \"Minas dos Matos Gerais\", the former name of the colonial province (\"Mines of the General Woods\"). So a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means \"General Mines\", with the word Gerais serving as an adjective to the mines, which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region. Another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history: the region of the mines (Minas), and the region of the Gerais (\"Matos Gerais\" or \"Campos Gerais\", which means something close to \"General Fields\"). These corresponded to the areas of [[Sertão]] which were farther and hard to access (with an economy based on farming and agriculture) from the mining spots (whose economic space was urban from its origin<ref>João Antônio de Paula: Raízes da Modernidade em Minas Gerais. Belo Horizonte: Editora Autêntica, 2000</ref>). The confusion comes from the fact that the term \"Gerais\" is taken as an adjective to \"Minas\" in the first version, although according to this point of view it refers to the region called Gerais (as a noun). A further complication is that this is not a well-defined area on the map of the state, but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots, more related to the geography of Sertão, and more isolated from the state's nucleus.\n",

It also shares a short boundary with the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Distrito Federal]] (northwest).

      "Minas Gerais features some of the longest rivers in Brazil, most notably the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]], the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and to a lesser extent, the [[Doce River|Rio Doce]]. The state also holds many hydroelectric power plants, including [[Furnas Reservoir|Furnas]]. Some of the highest peaks in Brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state, such as [[Serra da Mantiqueira]] and Serra do Cervo, that mark the border between Minas and its neighbors [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The most notable one is the [[Pico da Bandeira]], the third highest mountain in Brazil at 2890 m, standing on the border with Espírito Santo state. The state also has huge reserves of [[iron]] and sizeable reserves of [[gold]] and [[gemstones]], including [[emerald]], [[topaz]] and [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] mines.  Emeralds found in this location are comparable to the best [[Colombia]]-origin emeralds, and are most often a bluish-green color.<ref>Arem, Joel [http://www.gemsociety.org/article/beryl-jewelry-gemstone-information/ Beryl Gemology Information] Retrieved December 30, 2014.</ref>\n",

      "* The central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky, with little vegetation on the mountains. Around [[Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais|Lagoa Santa]] and [[Sete Lagoas]] a typical [[Karst topography]] with [[caves]] and [[lake]]s is found. Some of the mountains are almost entirely [[iron ore]], which led to extensive mining (in some places at the expense of the environment). Recent advances in environmental policy helped to put limits to mining. About {{convert|200|km|mi}} to the east of [[Belo Horizonte]] is the second Metropolitan Region of the state, [[Vale do Aço metropolitan area|Vale do Aço]] (''steel valley''), which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the [[Rio Doce]] and its tributaries. Vale do Aço's largest cities are [[Ipatinga]], [[Coronel Fabriciano]] and [[Timóteo]]. Now that mining is restricted large areas of forest are being removed for timber, charcoal and to clear land for cattle ranching. The original forest cover of these inland hills is very much fragmented. The city of [[Governador Valadares]] is in the limit of this region with the poorer North.\n",
      "* The south of Minas Gerais is hilly and green, with [[coffee]] and milk production. This region is notably cooler than the rest of the state, and some locations are subject to temperatures just below the freezing point during the winter. The region is also famed for its mineral-water resorts, including the cities of [[Poços de Caldas]], [[Lambari, Minas Gerais|Lambari]], [[São Lourenço, Minas Gerais|São Lourenço]] and [[Caxambu]]. Many industries are located at [[Varginha]] and [[Pouso Alegre]].\n",
      "* The southeast of the state, called [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] (''Forest Zone'') was the richest region until the mid 20th century, nowadays the biggest city, [[Juiz de Fora]], remains an important industrial, cultural and educational center, being also the fourth largest in the Minas state. The day-to-day living in the Zona da Mata however, is better represented by a group of smaller cities like [[Manhuaçu]] [[Além Paraíba]], [[Viçosa, Minas Gerais|Viçosa]], [[Leopoldina, Minas Gerais|Leopoldina]], [[Cataguases]], [[Muriaé]], [[Ubá]], [[Astolfo Dutra]] and several others. Those cities put together form a strong economic presence based mostly on agriculture, textiles and minerals. The city of the principal coffee region in Minas Gerais is [[São João do Manhuaçu]] situated in Zona da Mata.\n",
      "* The west of Minas Gerais, also known as \"''[[Triângulo Mineiro]]''\" (which means \"the Minas Triangle\", due to the geographic shape of this region), is composed of a particular type of [[savanna]], known as the ''[[Cerrado]]''. This region was initially occupied by large free-wheeling [[beef]] ranches, which are still important for the economy of the region. Over the 1990s, extensive [[soybean|soy]] and corn farms occupied much of the farming land available. The Cerrado is also one of the principal coffee-growing areas of Brazil. The main cities of this region are [[Uberlândia]], [[Uberaba]], [[Patos de Minas]] and [[Araguari]].\n",
      "* The north of Minas Gerais is part of the arid [[sertão]] of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Nordeste]], and is thus subject to frequent droughts. Recent irrigation projects use the water from the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco river]] for agriculture; the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state, which is subject to a regular rainfall pattern. The diamond mines of this region, mainly in [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], attracted miners but are now exhausted, and the remaining population lives in poor conditions, especially in the valley of the [[Jequitinhonha River]]. The region is, however, known for its high quality [[cachaça]] production. [[Salinas, Minas Gerais|Salinas]] in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage.

It was closely related to ''[[Saltasaurus]]'', a [[sauropod]] considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits, including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine; such osteoderms have also been found for Maxakalisaurus.

      "In [[colonial Brazil|the colonial era]], the [[Brazilian Highlands|Brazilian interior]] was colonized by Portuguese and [[bandeirantes]]. The [[Brazilian Gold Rush|Brazilian gold rush]] ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of [[gold]] (discovered 1693) and [[Gemstone|gems]], and later [[diamond]]s which come from the naturally occurring [[itacolumite]] rock that can be found in great numbers in the region. These helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages. In 1697, the Portuguese used enslaved African labor to start building the [[Estrada Real]], the \"royal road,\" that would connect the ports of cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Paraty]] to the mineral-rich regions of [[Ouro Preto]], Serro, and, at the northernmost point, [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]].\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to 1720, Minas Gerais was part of the [[captaincy of São Vicente]] (later renamed [[São Paulo e Minas de Ouro]]). The first capital of Minas Gerais, and seat of the local see, was the city of [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]]; it was later moved to [[Vila Rica]]. In the late 18th century, Vila Rica was the largest city in Brazil and one of the most populous in America. As the gold mines were exhausted over the 19th century, the city lost its importance; it was later renamed [[Ouro Preto]] and remained the state capital until the construction of the all-new, planned city of [[Belo Horizonte]] at the turn of the 20th century. The gold cycle left its mark in cities such as Mariana, [[Ouro Preto]], [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], [[Sabará]], [[Tiradentes (MG)|Tiradentes]] and [[São João del Rei]]. The relative isolation from European influence, added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals, helped the local people to develop their own style of art, which became known as [[Barroco Mineiro]]. Prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities. The most important artist of this period was Antônio Francisco Lisboa, who became known as [[Aleijadinho]]. His sculptural and architectural work, as exhibited in the [[Twelve Prophets of Aleijadinho|Twelve Prophets]] and [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi]] in Ouro Preto, are highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside Europe at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to art and architecture, there was an explosion of musical activity in Minas Gerais in the 18th century. Printed copies of European music, as well as accomplished musicians, made the journey to the area, and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication. Several composers worked in Minas Gerais in the 18th century, mainly in Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto), Sabará, Mariana, and other cities. Some of the names which have survived include [[José Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita]], [[Marcos Coelho Netto]], [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]] and [[Ignácio Parreiras Neves]]; they cultivated a style related to the [[Classical music era|classical]] European style but marked by more a more chordal, [[homophony|homophonic]] sound, and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments.\n",
      "\n",
      "[[Guimarães Rosa]]'s literature is mostly situated in Minas Gerais, with locations widely located across the State (hence the term General, although more concentrated in its north) rather than delimited and identifiable. This northern area began to be colonized (with brutal conflicts with the large Amerindian population who lived in some parts, especially in [[Vale do Jequitinhonha]]) and became accessible to colonists departing from Bahia up north, which made the Portuguese crown insert the region within the state of Minas Gerais's borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight; thus the state of MG was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "[[File:Rugendas - Habitans de Minas.jpg|thumb|left|People of Minas Gerais in the 1820s]]\n",
      "During the 18th century, mining exploration was strongly controlled by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Crown]], which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted (one fifth of all gold would go to the Crown). Several rebellions were attempted by the colonists, always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown. One of the most important was the [[Revolta de Felipe dos Santos|Felipe dos Santos revolt]] that ended with his execution but also with the separation of Minas Gerais of [[São Paulo]]. The most notable one, however, was the [[Inconfidência Mineira|Inconfidência]], started in 1789 by group of middle-class colonists, mostly intellectuals and young officers. They were inspired by the [[American Revolution|American]] and French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals. The conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled. The most famous of them, Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (known as [[Tiradentes]]), was hanged by order of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], becoming a local hero and a national martyr of Brazil. The Minas Gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background, along with the Latin motto \"Libertas quæ sera tamen\", \"freedom albeit late\"—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the \"Inconfidentes\", as the rebels became known.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the economic history of Brazil, Minas Gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the Brazilian northeast (based on sugarcane, that starts declining in the 18th century) to the southeast of the country, which still remains the major economic center. The large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of Portugal back to Brazil, progressively turning Rio de Janeiro into an important port city, from where these would be shipped to Portugal and where the Portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in 1808 after Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Portugal (see [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]]).\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—Minas Gerais has also played an important role on national politics. During the 19th century, politicians such as [[José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva]] were instrumental in the establishment of the Brazilian Empire under the rule of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] and later his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]]. After the installation of the Brazilian Republic, during the early 20th century, Minas Gerais shared the control of the national political scene with [[São Paulo]] in what became known as the \"[[Café com leite politics|Coffee with Milk]]\" (''café com leite'') political cycle (coffee being the major product of São Paulo, and milk representing Minas Gerais' dairy industry, despite the latter also being an important coffee producer).\n",
      "\n",
      "Minas Gerais was also home to two of the most influential Brazilian politicians of the second half of the 20th century. [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was president from 1956 to 1961, and he was responsible for the construction of [[Brasília]] as the new capital of Brazil. [[Tancredo Neves]] had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in 1984 to be the first civil president after the 1964 military countercoup. However, he died after a series of health complications just as he was about to assume the position. Also, Itamar, Brazil's previous president, lived there, though he was not born in Minas.\n",
